        You'll never believe what happened.

        Dear Diary, ...
        Today was the best day ever.
        I wore my new jeans with my favorite purple top. Everyone was asking me about them at lunch. 
        Speaking of lunch, it was pizza again :( 
        It should be good, but here it's so chewy and square.

        Dear Diary, ...
        We won our game today, and I scored two goals!
