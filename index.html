        You'll never believe what happened.
        I mean, can you believe that? It was sooooo uncool. ugh.

        Dear Diary, ...
        Today was the best day ever.
        I wore my new jeans with my favorite purple top. Everyone was asking me about them at lunch. 
        Speaking of lunch, it was pizza again :( 
        It should be good, but here it's so chewy and square.

        Dear Diary, ...
        We won our game today, and I scored two goals!

        Dear Diary, ...
        I am so mad that I couldn't sleepover with my friends. 
        I had to go to dinner for someboday birthday with my parents, and I don't even know them. 
        They were going to watch a funny movie and get ice cream after. I'm so mad!!!

        Dear Diary, ...
        The math test was really hard. I should've studied more (or at all).
